# Django 1.9 Skeleton

This is a Django Skeleton to start a new Project nearly from scratch.

It contains the polls app from the official Django tutorial and I use a simple Bootstrap Theme.

Featuring:
* Django 1.9
* User registration and authentication in the frontend
* Bootstrap 3.3.6
* Bootstrap Theme *Paper*
* Fontawesome Icons 4.6.0
